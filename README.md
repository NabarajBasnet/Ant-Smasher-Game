🎯 Purpose of the Game
The Ant Smasher Game is a fun and interactive web-based game designed to test players' reflexes and hand-eye coordination. The primary goal is to smash as many ants (or spiders) as possible before they escape, providing an entertaining way to unwind while also honing quick decision-making skills.

This project was also created to improve coding skills and demonstrate the use of advanced JavaScript concepts and HTML5 Canvas to build an engaging game experience.

🛠️ Technology Stack
The game was developed using the following technologies:

HTML5 Canvas: For rendering the game elements and animations.
CSS3: For styling the page and providing visual appeal.
JavaScript (ES6): The core language used to implement game mechanics like object movement, collision detection, and event handling.

🚀 Features
Interactive Gameplay: Click on moving spiders to "squash" them.
Collision Detection: Spiders are removed when clicked, providing a realistic experience.
Random Movement: Spiders move in unpredictable patterns to increase the challenge.
Dynamic Background: Adds visual depth to the game.
Live Updates: The game updates in real time without needing page refreshes.
